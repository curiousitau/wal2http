# HTTP Event Sink Commit Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the commit strategy for implementing the HTTP event sink functionality in the PostgreSQL replication checker. The goal is to create a clean, logical commit history that reflects the development process and makes it easy to understand the changes made.

## Commit Strategy

### 1. Foundational Changes
**Commit: "feat: add http event sink foundation"**
- Add `EventSink` trait to `ReplicationServer`
- Create `http_sink.rs` module with basic structure
- Add HTTP sink configuration options to `ReplicationConfig`
- Initial implementation of `HttpEventSink` struct
- Basic integration with `ReplicationServer`

### 2. Event Processing
**Commit: "feat: implement event processing for http sink"**
- Implement `EventProcessor` struct
- Add mapping from `ReplicationMessage` to `HttpEvent`
- Implement `format_payload` method for HTTP transmission
- Add event processing tests

### 3. HTTP Client Implementation
**Commit: "feat: add http client implementation"**
- Choose and integrate HTTP client library (reqwest)
- Implement `send_request` method with basic functionality
- Add support for different HTTP methods
- Implement basic authentication header support

### 4. Full Integration
**Commit: "feat: integrate http event sink with replication server"**
- Complete integration of `HttpEventSink` with `ReplicationServer`
- Pass configuration from `ReplicationConfig` to `HttpEventSink`
- Ensure event processing is non-blocking
- Add proper error handling and logging

### 5. Configuration Enhancements
**Commit: "feat: enhance http sink configuration"**
- Add comprehensive HTTP sink configuration options
- Implement environment variable parsing for HTTP sink
- Add validation for HTTP endpoint URL
- Add fallback values for missing configuration

### 6. Error Handling and Retry Logic
**Commit: "feat: add error handling and retry logic"**
- Implement robust error handling for event processing
- Add retry logic for HTTP requests
- Implement comprehensive logging for successful and failed events
- Add graceful degradation for HTTP sink failures

### 7. Testing
**Commit: "test: add unit tests for http event sink"**
- Write unit tests for `EventProcessor`
- Write unit tests for `HttpClient`
- Write unit tests for `HttpEventSink`
- Add integration tests for full event processing flow

**Commit: "test: add performance tests for http event sink"**
- Test performance impact on main replication processing
- Measure latency of HTTP event processing
- Test with high event volume
- Test retry logic under network failures

### 8. Documentation and Final Touches
**Commit: "docs: add http event sink documentation"**
- Add comprehensive documentation for HTTP event sink
- Include examples of HTTP endpoint implementations
- Provide monitoring and logging guidance
- Include performance considerations in documentation

**Commit: "chore: finalize http event sink implementation"**
- Clean up any remaining code
- Ensure all tests pass
- Verify backward compatibility
- Final review and polishing

## Commit Message Guidelines

1. Use imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature"
2. Reference issues if applicable: "feat: add http event sink #123"
3. Keep messages concise but descriptive
4. Use emojis for categorization:
   - ‚úÖ feat: new features
   - üêõ fix: bug fixes
   - üìù docs: documentation changes
   - üß™ test: test additions
   - üîß chore: maintenance tasks

## Branch Strategy

- Create a feature branch: `feature/http-event-sink`
- Make incremental commits following the strategy above
- Regularly merge from main to keep up with changes
- Use pull requests for code reviews

## Review Process

- Each commit should be small and focused
- Include relevant tests with each feature implementation
- Document any trade-offs or design decisions
- Ensure backward compatibility is maintained
- Verify that the HTTP event sink is disabled by default

## Rollback Plan

- HTTP event sink is optional and disabled by default
- Configuration-driven activation
- Graceful degradation if HTTP sink fails
- No changes to existing replication functionality
- Can be safely disabled by removing the HTTP endpoint URL configuration

# Structured Logging with Correlation IDs - Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented item #9 from the Production Readiness Assessment: **Structured Logging** with correlation IDs and request tracing.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Core Infrastructure**
- **Correlation ID Generation**: Automatic unique IDs for tracking request chains
- **Tracing Context**: Context propagation across the replication lifecycle
- **Structured Logging**: JSON and console format support with configurable output

### 2. **Key Features**

#### Correlation ID Management
```rust
// Automatic generation with timestamp and counter
let correlation_id = CorrelationId::new();

// UUID-based for distributed systems
let correlation_id = CorrelationId::new_uuid();
```

#### Tracing Context
```rust
// Server-level context with correlation ID
let context = TracingContext::new();

// Child contexts for specific operations
let child_context = context.child_context("replication_message");
```

#### Structured Logging Output
```bash
# JSON Format (production)
{"timestamp":"2025-01-13T10:30:45.123Z","level":"info","target":"wal2http","span":{"replication_context":{"correlation_id":"1736758245123-1"}},"message":"Starting replication loop"}

# Console Format (development)
INFO  Starting replication loop correlation_id=1736758245123-1
```

### 3. **Integration Points**

#### Server Operations
- Database connection establishment
- Replication slot and publication validation
- WAL message processing
- Event sink delivery

#### Event Sink Enhancement
- HTTP events now include correlation ID in payload
- STDOUT events show correlation ID prefix
- Hook0 events include correlation ID in metadata

#### Configuration
```bash
# Enable JSON logging for production
export LOG_FORMAT=json

# Default console format for development
export LOG_FORMAT=console
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Application Startup
```bash
$ LOG_FORMAT=json ./wal2http
{"timestamp":"2025-01-13T10:30:45.123Z","level":"info","message":"Initialized structured logging with JSON format"}
{"timestamp":"2025-01-13T10:30:45.124Z","level":"info","fields":{"correlation_id":"1736758245124-0"},"message":"wal2http starting up"}
```

### 2. Replication Events
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-13T10:30:46.456Z",
  "level": "info",
  "fields": {
    "correlation_id": "1736758245124-0",
    "operation": "replication_message",
    "message_type": "Insert"
  },
  "message": "Sending event to event sink"
}
```

### 3. HTTP Event Delivery
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-13T10:30:46.789Z",
  "level": "info",
  "fields": {
    "correlation_id": "1736758245124-0",
    "lsn": "16/3F8B4E8"
  },
  "message": "Successfully sent event to sink"
}
```

### 4. HTTP Event Payload with Correlation ID
```json
{
  "table": "users",
  "operation": "INSERT",
  "data": {...},
  "correlation_id": "1736758245124-0"
}
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Request Tracing**
- Complete traceability of database changes through the system
- Easy correlation between WAL events and external API calls
- Debugging simplified with unique request identifiers

### 2. **Operational Monitoring**
- Structured logs enable easy filtering and searching
- JSON format compatible with log aggregation systems (ELK, Splunk)
- Consistent log format across all components

### 3. **Production Readiness**
- Addresses production readiness item #9 completely
- Provides foundation for distributed tracing
- Enables proper observability for replication events

### 4. **Performance Insights**
- Correlation IDs help track event latency
- Easy to measure end-to-end processing time
- Identify bottlenecks in the replication pipeline

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Log format (console|json)
LOG_FORMAT=json

# Log level (trace|debug|info|warn|error)
RUST_LOG=info

# Additional tracing filters
RUST_LOG=wal2http=debug,tokio=info
```

## Next Steps

The structured logging implementation provides a solid foundation for:

1. **Metrics Integration**: Add Prometheus metrics with correlation ID tagging
2. **Distributed Tracing**: Integration with Jaeger/Zipkin for full observability
3. **Alerting**: Correlation-aware alerting for replication failures
4. **Performance Analysis**: End-to-end latency tracking with correlation IDs

## Verification

To test the implementation:

```bash
# Start with JSON logging
cd backends/wal2http
LOG_FORMAT=json cargo run -- --host=localhost --user=postgres --dbname=test

# View structured logs with correlation IDs
tail -f /var/log/wal2http.log | jq '.fields.correlation_id'
```

The implementation successfully addresses all requirements for production-ready structured logging with correlation IDs and request tracing.
